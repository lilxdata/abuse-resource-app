            Studies show that treatment is one of the most effective ways to avoid repeat sexual assaults. You can make
            this process easier for the person you know by encouraging them to seek out treatment, helping them 
            schedule appointments, and even accompanying them to their appointments. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            To begin scheduling appointments for them, you can search for therapists in your area who specialize in 
            dealing with people who commit sexual assault. The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers 
            has <a href="http://www.atsa.com/referral"> a tool to direct you to sexual assault behavior therapists. </a>
            Through their tool, in addition to finding a therapist for the person you know, 
            you can also find a therapist to help you deal with what you are going through.
