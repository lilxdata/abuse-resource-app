            While we cannot change the past, we can control what happens in the future. In order to prevent committing 
            future assaults, there are resources out there to learn how to manage your behavior. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            One way to do this is to create a <a href="dummy"> relapse prevention plan </a>, where you outline scenarios and risk 
            factors that may cause you to reoffend and ways to intervene when those situations occur.
