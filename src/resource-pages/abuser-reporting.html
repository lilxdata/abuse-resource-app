        <p> 
            Many people who have committed abuse find that it helps to stop their abuse by reporting what they have done. 
            In order to legally report an assault you have committed, you can contract your local police department. 
        </p>

            If you do not want to move forward with law enforcement, you can start by taking accountability for your abuse.
            To learn more about this, read <a href="dummy"> Creative Intervention's guide for taking accountability. </a>
