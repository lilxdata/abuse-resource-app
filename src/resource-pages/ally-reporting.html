                    Reporting a sexual assault that someone you know committed can be hard for numerous reasons.
                    The first is that the person you are reporting is someone that you know personally, and maybe someone that you care about.
                    Other reasons could be that you do not know what reporting entails, how or where to report a sexual assault, or 
                    being unsure of the consequences of reporting. 
                </p>
                <p class="info"> 
                    If you would like to report an assault, you can contact your local police department. However, if you do not
                    feel comfortable engaging with the police, you can still keep the person who committed the assault 
                    accountable to their actions by using principles of community accountability. You can read more about that
                    through  <a href="http://www.creative-interventions.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/4.F.CI-Toolkit-Tools-Taking-Accountability-Pre-Release-Version-06.2012.pdf" class="link" target="_blank"> Creative Intervention's guide for taking accountability. </a>
                </p>
                <p class="info">
                   If you are unsure which route to go, you can talk to someone else who you trust and who also knows this person about how you are feeling
                   and what you are thinking. A second opinion can help solidify your decision.
