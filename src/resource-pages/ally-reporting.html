            Reporting a sexual assault that someone you know committed can be hard for numerous reasons.  
        </p>
        <p> 
            In order to report an assault, you can contact your local police department. However, if you do not
            feel comfortable engaging with the police, you can still keep the person who committed the assault 
            accountable to their actions by using principles of community accountability. You can read more about that
            through  <a href="http://www.creative-interventions.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/4.F.CI-Toolkit-Tools-Taking-Accountability-Pre-Release-Version-06.2012.pdf"> Creative Intervention's guide for taking accountability. </a>
