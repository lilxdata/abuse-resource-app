            Self-care is important in our daily lives to stay physically and mentally healthy, and even more so in times of trauma. 
            Whether or not you yourself have experienced assault, it can be triggering and emotionally tolling to find out someone
            you know has committed a sexual assault.

            When navigating through this process, it is important to check in with yourself and ensure that you are taking care of 
            yourself. 
            <a href ="https://rainn.org/articles/self-care-friends-and-family">RAINN has a guide for self-care for friends and family </a>
            that you can use to understand how you are feeling. It is for friends and family of people who have experienced sexual assault, 
            but just as relevant to those who have found out someone they know has committed sexual assault.
