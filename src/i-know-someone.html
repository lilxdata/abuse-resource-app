           Finding out someone you know has committed a sexual assault is a hard thing to go through, and often it is not
           clear what you should do in the situation. Many people decide to either ignore the act that the person did or 
           cut off contact with the person who has committed the sexual assault. While these are valid responses, neither
           of these reactions will prevent the person from committing sexual assaults in the future. 
        </p>

            It is good that you are here to help direct the person to resources to prevent future offenses, and to take
            care of yourself in the process.
