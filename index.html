                This app was designed to help people who know someone who has sexually assaulted someone else. 
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Finding out someone you know has committed a sexual assault is a hard thing to go through, and often it is not
                clear what you should do in the situation. It is good that you are here to help direct the person to resources to prevent future offenses, and to take
                care of yourself in the process.
            </p>
            <p class ="info">
                We want to address all parts of the cycle of abuse in order to more quickly bring an end to it, and to stress that
                the burden is not on the person who has survived sexual assault to end sexual assault. 
                Currently, this app does not have resources specifically for people who have survived sexual assault, so if that is you, 
                <a href="https://www.rainn.org/after-sexual-assault"> visit RAINN to find resources for what to do after sexual assault. </a>
